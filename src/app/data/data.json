            "React is an open-source JavaScript library which renders data as HTML", 
            "React operates off of a 'data tree', which essentially boils down to passing data between 'reusable components'", 
            "To expand on 'reusable components', the best example would be a button component",
            "We utilize 'props' to pass data around the tree, which will manipulate the button as required",
            "We can also use 'PropTypes' to specify what we expect for the component ('isRequired' can specifically throw a console error if rules aren't followed)",
            "'Reusable components' should be kept as small as possible; if they serve more than one purpose create a new component",
            "Here's how FaceBook describes component-based development within React:",
            "Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM."

            "You can take advantage of 'state', which will allow for the DOM to rerender every time a components state changes", 
            "This can be really powerful when handling DOM changes",
            "In its simplest form React will allow for a cleaner, more efficient and much faster application than a plain HTML application"
